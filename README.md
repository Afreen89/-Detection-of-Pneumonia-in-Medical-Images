# -Detection-of-Pneumonia-in-Medical-Images
The goal of this task is to explore a range of machine learning classifiers, inspired by the various models and categories and beyond i.e. from reading and literature. At least two of the deep learning classifiers should be included as baselines. In addition, two proposed classifiers attempt to go beyond the task in terms of architectural, approach, and/or algorithmic details. I investigated their performance, compare and critique them to justify the recommended classifier(s). This includes metrics such as TP/FP rates, Precision-Recall, F-measure, and any other relevant metrics.
