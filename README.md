# -Detection-of-Pneumonia-in-Medical-Images
The goal of this task is to explore a range of machine learning classifiers, inspired by the various models and categories and beyond i.e. from reading and literature. I will implement ANN and CNN as baseslines, In addition, there will be two deep learning frameworks to go beyond the baselines, namely VGG19 and ResNet50.

### Dataset
The dataset is divided into train, test and valudation. It can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wxB8BC5JRoX-BBXmXRxFxzPiOM2Af-xN)

### Evaluating Results
I will investigate their performance, compare and critique them to justify the two deep learning classifier(s). This includes metrics such as TP/FP rates, Precision-Recall, F-measure, and any other relevant metrics.
